This project was born out of my development of [PandaOS](https://github.com/FancyKillerPanda/PandaOS), a small toy operating system I created to help me learn more about the inner-workings of my computer.

I was inspired to create this due to the lack of good guides on internet about this subject. While it is possible for you to copy along with this guide, I highly recommend modifying what I create to create something of your own. Not only will that project be something you can actually call *yours*, but it will give you much more satisfaction when you are done with it.

This is an ongoing project, being worked on alongside PandaOS. Honestly, I don't know how far I'll even get with this guide. But here's a start... at least.
